# Fair Fare

Fair Fair gives price estimates for taxis and ridesharing services for a route provided by the user.
This project uses a GB tree model trained on public taxi and ridesharing data from the city of Chicago.
Predictions are made by getting user route and time information combined with the google maps API to get additional features
such as the the estimated trip time under current traffic conditions.
