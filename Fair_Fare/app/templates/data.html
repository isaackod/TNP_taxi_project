<h3>Problem: Youâ€™re flying into Chicago tomorrow. Should you use a ridesharing app to reach your hotel, or take a taxi? How much do you expect to pay?
</h3>

<h3>The Data: 100 Million taxi and ridesharing trips from the city of Chicago.
    Somtimes ridesharing is cheaper, and sometimes taxis are for the same trip.
</h3>

<h3>Solution: Train a ML model to predict prices for each type of trip, and run the model in real-time.
